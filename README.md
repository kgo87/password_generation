# Password_Generation
This repository contains the solution for the homework assignment for unit 3 of UW Coding Bootcamp. 

# Task

* When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they can select the length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters) and types of characters to be used in the password (numbers, lowercase, uppercase, and special characters).

# URL to a live page

# Finished product
Here are several screenshots showing the functionality of the developed password generator.
